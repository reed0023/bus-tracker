# Bus-Tracker

This project fetches bus location data, then displays it on a map of Boston once the button on the webpage is clicked. The location data is available via mapbox api. You must obtain a token from mapbox in order to use this tracker on your own machine. The token is located in the mapanimation.js file - replace the current token with your own to get started. 

In the future, I'd like to add other routes between the various universities in Boston.
